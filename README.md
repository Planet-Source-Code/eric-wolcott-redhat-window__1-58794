### Description

I wrote this to use along with my RedHat shell. It isnt quite done yet. Ive basicly subclassed everything with OnMouseOver and OnMouseLeave abilities. The form will resize without a Timer, API only. Doesnt seem to respond well with slower machine when resizing. Tell me what you think. This program has no purpose, just basicly EyeCandy.
